| Computation Time | 100% baseline | ~60% baseline | **40% faster** |
| Path Optimality | Guaranteed optimal | Guaranteed optimal | **Equal quality** |

### Transport Mode Analysis
- **Drone Delivery**: Shorter total distance, direct point-to-point routes
- **Truck Delivery**: Longer but single continuous route
