Interactive Pathfinding Algorithm Demonstration

This module provides an educational visualization of pathfinding algorithms
on a 2D grid. Users can create obstacles by clicking, then run Dijkstra's 
algorithm or A* search to see how each algorithm explores the grid and 
finds optimal paths.

Features:
- Interactive obstacle placement
- Real-time algorithm visualization with step-by-step progression
- Performance comparison between Dijkstra and A* algorithms  
- Automatic screenshot generation for analysis
- Adjustable animation speed for detailed observation

Educational Purpose:
Demonstrates the differences in exploration patterns between uninformed 
(Dijkstra) and informed (A*) search algorithms.
